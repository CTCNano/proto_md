Functions to calculate dynamic properties of cg variables. 
Most functions here can take either a System or Timestep as arguments. 
This is convienient for analysis/debugging purposes

    # finally, [:,newaxis] reshapes it to a column vector.
    # so ordering of flattend array is [[subsystem.0.cgs, subsystem.1.cgs, ..., subsystem.n.cgs]].
    return mean(mean(obj.cg_forces, axis = 0), axis = 1).flatten()[:,newaxis]
